Installation
============

When using the HouseShare Assistant web application for the first time, make sure that the repository is downloaded locally from GitHub and that your terminal is connected to the
local clone of the repository.

For example:

.. code_block:: bash

    PS C:\users\my_user\repository_name

.. code-block:: python
    
    def my_function():
        print("Hello, world!")
